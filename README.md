Custom Maps With Esri's ArcGIS JS API
=================

This is a quick write-up on extending the standard ArcGIS Javascript API to include calls to
3 types of customized basemaps. [Spoiler Alert] I'm not a developer.

=================

###Using an Esri Web Map  
Through your ArcGIS Online account, you can create any number of styled maps using a combination
of Esri basemaps, services and layers hosted in the AGOL infastructure. Those can also be
customized to include a tiled map service from a non-Esri provider. Lots of details on that
can be found in a previous write-up: **[Custom Basemaps In ArcGIS Online](https://github.com/jonahadkins/Custom-Basemaps-In-AGOL)**. Using an AGOL web map requires
a valid web map id; this example also assumes that the web map has been shared publically. If you navigate to your
web map in your browser the web map id can be copied from the url:  

`http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=df64031882e74a8db5fa5a94b3f25415`

You'll want to grab everything after `webmap=`, which in this case is **df64031882e74a8db5fa5a94b3f25415**


Code:  
```javascript
var map;  
require([  
      "esri/map",  
      "esri/arcgis/utils",  
      "dojo/domReady!"  
      ], function(Map, arcgisUtils){
      arcgisUtils.createMap("df64031882e74a8db5fa5a94b3f25415", "mapDiv").then(function (response) {
          map = response.map;
      });
});
  ```  
This example includes tiled layers brought over from Stamen Design's cool [MapStack](http://mapstack.stamen.com/) service, which was then saved as an AGOL web map.

###Using ArcGIS Server or an AGOL Map Service
You can use your public ArcGIS Server instance, or one that is hosted in ArcGIS Online to implement
a custom basemap in the ArcGIS JS API. This method is fairly straight forward and
requires access to a public map service like the [Most Recent Virginia Imagery](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=7780125c142c450cb8f6b4db4d121806) service provided by VGIN.
What we look for in this case is the map server address, which usually looks like:  

`http://gismaps.vita.virginia.gov/arcgis/rest/services/MostRecentImagery/MostRecentImagery_WGS/MapServer`  

Code:
```javascript
var map;
require(["esri/map", "dojo/domReady!"], function(Map) {
    map = new Map("map", {
        basemap: "topo",
        center: [-76.386, 37.040], // longitude, latitude
        zoom: 10
    });
    // Adding A New Basemap From An Existing Rest/Map Service
    var baseMapLayer = new esri.layers.ArcGISTiledMapServiceLayer
        ("http://gismaps.vita.virginia.gov/arcgis/rest/services/MostRecentImagery/MostRecentImagery_WGS/MapServer");
    map.addLayer(baseMapLayer);
});
```

###Using a Web Tile Layer  
You can also implement a non-Esri web tile layer from any number of service providers. In this example
we will use the popular [Standard Toner](http://maps.stamen.com/#toner/12/37.7706/-122.3782) from Stamen
Design. To get started, you'll need to find the url pattern for thier service which is:

`http://d.tile.stamen.com/toner/14/2626/6331.png`  

It's a standard setup with the tile subdomain listed as `d` and the `14/2626/6331` as the z/x/y configuration.

Code:  

```javascript
var map;
require(["esri/map", "esri/layers/WebTiledLayer", "dojo/parser", "dojo/domReady!"],
    function(Map, WebTiledLayer, parser) {
    parser.parse();
    map = new Map("map", {
          center: [-76.386, 37.040],
          zoom: 10
    });
    var customMap = new WebTiledLayer("http://${subDomain}.tile.stamen.com/toner/${level}/${col}/${row}.png", {
          "copyright": 'Map tiles by <a href="http://stamen.com">Stamen Design</a>, under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC BY 3.0</a>. Data by <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>, under <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">ODbL</a>.',
          "id": "Toner",
          "subDomains": ["a", "b", "c"]
    });
    map.addLayer(customMap);
});
```

Always remember to include attribution when it's required. For using Toner, include this `html` (which is also described on [their website](http://maps.stamen.com/#watercolor/12/37.7706/-122.3782))
